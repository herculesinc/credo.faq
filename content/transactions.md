# Transactions

## What is a transaction?
Anything that involves an exchange of goods or services is a transaction (think buying a couch on Craigslist or renting an apartment). You can make such transactions safer by conducting them on Credo (this is very important!). This will do two things: first, it will create a historical record of the transaction for you, but more importantly, once a transaction is confirmed, both parties will be able to rate and review each other.

## How do I confirm a transaction on Credo?
The simplest way to confirm a transaction with someone is to send them a payment via Credo for the goods or services they provided. There are a couple of [payment methods](#what-payment-methods-can-i-use) you can use, and more are on the way. Once they accept the payment, the money will be transferred, and the transaction will be confirmed.

If you didn't pay through Credo (e.g. you used cash), not a problem. Just send a "transaction confirmation request" to the other user. Once they accept the request, the transaction will be confirmed.

Finally, you can make an agreement with another user to exchange goods or services for a certain amount of money sometime in the future. The agreement will become a confirmed transaction once the payment is made and confirmed.

Just a reminder, you can't use Credo to send money to other users (e.g. friends or family) without buying something from them.

## What payment methods can I use?
Currently, we support the following payment methods:

* [Credo Wallet](credo-wallet#what-is-credo-wallet) - will let you make and accept instant payments right here on Credo, but available in the U.S. only.
* [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) - will let you send and receive Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ether using your Coinbase account.

We are working on adding other payment methods, and will send out updates as soon as they become available.

## How much money can I send/receive?
Currently, you can send up to $500 week and also receive up to $500 a week. In the future, your limits will depend on your Credo Score: the better the score, the higher the limits. You can always check your remaining weekly limits in your account settings.

## Can I change or cancel a transaction?
You can change or cancel a transaction up until the time it is confirmed. However, once a transaction is confirmed, there is no way back.

You can also terminate an agreement for a future transaction at any time. In this case, both parties will still be able to rate and review each other.

## Can I reject a transaction from another user?
Yes. Transactions are not accepted automatically. You can reject a transaction and/or payment sent to you by another user. However, once you accept the transaction, it can no longer be changed or canceled.

## What happens if another user does not accept my transaction?
The other user has 5 days to accept your transaction. If they don't accept it within 5 days, the transaction is canceled automatically. If you had a payment associated with the transaction, the payment will be canceled as well.

## Are there transaction fees?
Currently, we do not charge any transaction fees. We may add small transaction fees in the future to help us cover our costs, but don't worry - they won't break your bank.

## How long does it take to send/receive money to/from another user?
This depends on the payment method. With current payment methods, money transfers from one user to another are instantaneous.

## Where can I find my transactions history?
All of your confirmed transactions and agreements are listed on your Dashboard.

## What do I do if there's a problem with my transaction?
In case of a dispute with another user over a transaction, try to work it out with them - chances are, you'll be able to come up with an amicable solution. If this fails, make sure to rate and review that user accordingly. This will help others know how to deal with this person.

If you have a technical problem or believe that another user has committed fraud, notify us immediately at [support@credo360.com](mailto:support@credo360.com) and we'll try to help.
