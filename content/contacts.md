# Contacts

## What is a Contact?
Think of Contacts as your Credo address book. It can include users with whom you communicated or intend to communicate via Credo Messenger as well as people from your Circle of Trust. If you have someone's Credo ID, you can add them to your Contacts. People from your Circle of Trust are added to your contacts automatically.

In addition, if your Credo account is connected to Facebook, you will be notified when your Facebook friends join Credo. Then you will have the option to add them to your Credo contacts.

## What are the Blocked contacts?
You can add people to Blocked Contacts if you want to stop receiving messages from them. A blocked user will not be able send you messages but they will still see the "Public" elements of your profile. Please keep in mind that if you had transactions with a user, blocking them will not prevent them from rating you or writing a review for you.

## Can I delete someone from my Contacts?
Yes, you can delete people from your Contacts at any time.

## What is a Circle of Trust?
Circle of Trust is a group of people who you believe can vouch for you. They know you well and you have an established trust relationship. Think about them as your closest friends and family. To add someone to your Circle of Trust you will need to send a "trust request" to them and they will need to approve it. You should be very selective about whom you want to include into your Circle of Trust because your [Credo Score](reputation-and-feedback#what-is-the-credo-score-and-how-is-it-calculated) is directly affected by their Credo Score and vice-versa.

Once someone is in your Circle of Trust, they can write a review for you immediately (and you can do the same for them). They will also be able see your full profile (including elements set to "private" visibility) and read reviews others have written for you.

## Can I remove someone from my Circle of Trust?
Yes, you can remove people from your Circle of Trust at any time.
