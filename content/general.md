## What is Credo360?
Credo360 (or simply Credo) is a way to demonstrate your credibility to others without compromising [privacy](privacy). Anyone can get a free [Credo ID](credo-accounts#what-is-a-credo-id) and display it in a public place. With the help of Credo ID, strangers can get some notion of each other's credibility and make educated decisions about people around them.

## Is another rating site really needed? Are reviews on eBay, Airbnb etc. not sufficient?
We believe it is important to have a common and free service, which could be used to quickly establish someone's credibility. There are a number of challenges with the eBay and Airbnb ratings, when those ratings need to be considered outside of their relative sites. For example, it is not easy to confirm that the person who claims to have a particular eBay profile is the actual owner. It's also virtually impossible to share your eBay or Airbnb profile, without giving away your full name, private details of your residence, and a history of the items that you've sold or rented. Most folks can't easily get an eBay "history" without buying and/or selling multiple items, and even then, their ability to pay promptly may not give a full picture of their credibility.

## Isn't rating people fundamentally wrong?
Yes, it is - but that's not what we are doing. Your [Credo Score](reputation-and-feedback#what-is-the-credo-score-and-how-is-it-calculated) is not a reflection of how good, kind, funny, smart etc. you are. We are not trying to assess your personality or evaluate you as a human being. Your Credo Score is a measure of just one aspect of your character - your credibility (how trustworthy you are).

## Who can use Credo?
Anybody who is 16 years old or older can use Credo as long as they agree to the [Terms of Service](https://www.credo360.com/legal#terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.credo360.com/legal#privacy). Anyone younger than 18 years old must have their parent(s)/legal guardian(s) permission to join the site.

## How much does it cost to use Credo?
Using Credo is completely free. We will not show you any ads or sell your data to anyone. In the future, we will introduce "premium" features and will charge money for them. This way, we'll be able to cover our costs. But core functionality of Credo will always remain free.

## Do you have Credo360 apps for smart phones?
Yes, beta version of the Android app is already in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.credo360.android). We are planning a full release by the summer of 2018, and the iPhone app will follow shortly thereafter.
