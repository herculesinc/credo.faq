Anyone can get a free <a href='#what-is-a-credo-id'>Credo ID</a> and display it in a public place.

        "answer": "<p>We believe it is important to have a common and free service, which could be used to quickly establish someone's credibility. There are a number of challenges with the eBay and Airbnb ratings, when those ratings need to be considered outside of their relative sites. For example, it is not easy to confirm that the person who claims to have a particular eBay profile is the actual owner. It's also virtually impossible to share your eBay or Airbnb profile, without giving away your full name, private details of your residence, and a history of the items that you've sold or rented. Most folks can't easily get an eBay \"history\" without buying and/or selling multiple items, and even then, their ability to pay promptly may not give a full picture of their credibility.</p>"

For example, even though you do not have to fill out all of the profile fields, the more complete your profile, the stronger it is. Also, your profile strength increases significantly if your name and/or other profile fields match your social media profiles.</li><li>Endorsements component depends on the number and reputation of people who are willing to vouch for you - i.e., people in your Circle of Trust. Generally speaking, the more people you have in your Circle of Trust and the better their reputation, the higher the bump in your Credo Score. However, once you reach about a dozen of people in your Circle of Trust, any further increase in the number of people will not have a significant effect on your Credo Score.</li><li>Feedback component has the greatest impact on your Credo score and consists of ratings and reviews you receive from other users. The more consistent and positive ratings you receive, the higher your Credo Score will be and vice-versa.</li></ul><p>Even though Identity and Endorsements components do not affect your Credo Score as strongly as the Feedback, they are important components overall. This means that having credible verifications, strong profile and reliable people in your Circle of Trust will help improve your Credo Score.</p>"
