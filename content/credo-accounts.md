# Credo Accounts

## How do I create a Credo account?
The easiest way to create a Credo account is by using your existing Facebook or LinkedIn profile. Just click on Facebook or LinkedIn buttons on the Login screen, allow Credo360 app to read your Facebook or LinkedIn profile, and you are good to go. We need access to your profiles only to verify your info, and we will never post anything to your Facebook or LinkedIn profiles.

You can also use your phone or email address to sign up. In this case, you will receive an email or a text message with an activation code that you'll need to use to activate your account.

## What information is required to create a Credo account?
We need only your first name and one [account verification](verifications#what-is-account-verification) to create an account for you. This is the bare minimum which you can complement at any time to make your account more credible. For example, you can upload your profile picture or provide your last name, age, location and other information. You can also add more verifications to the account to increase your [Credo Score](reputation-and-feedback#what-is-the-credo-score-and-how-is-it-calculated).

## How do I login once I have an account?
When you sign up, you will be automatically logged into your account. Subsequently, you can use any of the following methods to login: Facebook, LinkedIn, phone number or email address - assuming you have connected them to your Credo account. Just choose the method you'd like to use in the Login Section and follow the prompt.

On the website, you can also choose to stay logged in for up to 14 days. To do this, check the "Remember me for 14 days" option after you log in.

## What should I do if I believe someone's account is false?
If you believe someone's account is fake or fraudulent, please flag that account or contact us at [support@credo360.com](mailto:support@credo360.com) to report it.

## Can I close my Credo account?
Yes, you can close it at any time. In some cases, closing an account may take up to 24 hours. If you have any balance remaining in your [Credo Wallet](credo-wallet#what-is-credo-wallet), you'll need to withdraw the money before closing your account.

## What happens to my data when I close my account?
Once you close your account, we remove all your personally identifiable information from the system. Meaning, nobody (not even us) will be able to link the information that remains in the system back to you.

Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.credo360.com/legal#privacy) for additional information on what data is retained after you close your Credo account.

## Can I reopen my closed Credo account?
Yes! To reopen your account, log in using one of the verifications you had attached to your account. If your account was verified with Facebook and/or LinkedIn, we will be able to restore your reviews, and your [Credo Score](reputation-and-feedback#what-is-the-credo-score-and-how-is-it-calculated) will pick up from where you left off when you closed your account.

## What is a Credo ID?
Credo ID is your unique identifier on Credo. Think about it as your phone number or e-mail address. You can give your Credo ID to other people so that they can look up your profile and send you messages.

When you sign up, Credo ID is set to a random 11-digit number, but it is possible to [change](#can-i-change-my-credo-id) it.

## Can I change my Credo ID?
You can regenerate your Credo ID once every 7 days to replace your existing ID with a new random number. If you have a mobile phone connected to your account, you can set your Credo ID to be your phone number.

You can also request a custom ID to make it more personable. To request a custom Credo ID, you'll need to invite 5 of your friends to join Credo. You can read more about it [here](https://www.credo360.com/perks#custom-credo-id). In the future, we will have other ways of obtaining custom Credo IDs as well.

## What happens when I change my Credo ID?
Your new Credo ID will not automatically link to your old ID. This means that people who are not in your Circle of Trust will not be able to find you by your old Credo ID unless you give them your new ID.
