# User Interaction

## How can I find people on Credo?
You can look people up using our search. Currently, there are 3 ways to search for people: by their Credo ID, email address, or mobile phone number. You can look someone up by their Credo ID even if you don't have a Credo account, but you need to be logged in, to find someone by their email or phone number. In addition, you can search for people by their first and last names if they are in your contact list or if you've interacted with them on Credo in the past.

If someone has connected their Twitter and/or Reddit account to Credo, you can look them up by their Twitter handle or Reddit username respectively. For Twitter, use the link https\://www.credo360.com/twitter/xxx and replace "xxx" with the person's Twitter handle. For Reddit, follow the link https\://www.credo360.com/reddit/xxx and replace "xxx" with the person's Reddit username, e.g., [irakliy81](https://www.credo360.com/reddit/irakliy81).

Also, if your Credo account is connected to Facebook, we will notify you when your Facebook friends join Credo.

## Can I invite people to Credo?
Yes! Currently, you can invite people via email or SMS. If they accept your invitation and register, you will be notified and offered to add them to your contact list. You can also post your referral link on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc., and you'll be notified if anyone joins using your link.

If 5 or more people you invite join and get their Credo Score over 200, you'll be able to claim a [custom Credo URL](https://www.credo360.com/perks#custom-credo-id).

## How do I share my profile with others?
If you want someone to see your profile, give them your Credo ID or a link to your profile page.

## How do I communicate with other Credo users?
You can start conversations with one or more people using our messenger. We encourage people to use Credo Messenger (instead of SMS or email) as you will know exactly who you are dealing with, and you won't be revealing your personal info such as your email address or a phone number.

To start a conversation, you need to have a Credo ID of the user you'd like to send messages to. Currently, up to 8 people can participate in a single conversation.

## What can I send via Credo Messenger?
Just like with most messengers out there, you can use Credo Messenger to send texts and files. In addition, you can schedule meetings, make payments, create agreements, and confirm transactions right in the messenger. Take a look at [Transactions](transactions#what-is-a-transaction) section below for more info on payments, transactions, and agreements.

## Can I prevent certain people from contacting me on Credo?
Yes, you can block people with whom you don't want to talk. Once blocked, they will not be able to send any messages to you.

In the future, you will be able to set a [Credo Score](reputation-and-feedback#reputation-and-feedback) threshold, and only people with Credo Score at or above that threshold will be able to contact you.

## Can I invite people into ongoing conversations?
Yes, you can invite additional people into ongoing conversations by sending them an invite or a link to the conversation. Currently, we allow up to 8 participants in a single conversation. Depending on conversation settings, invited people will be able to join the conversation immediately, or they will have to be approved by other conversation participants before joining.

## What are "Invite Confirmations"?
When Invite Confirmations are enabled, nobody can join a conversation or see it unless they are invited and approved to join by all conversation participants. However, when Invite Confirmations are off, any conversation participant can invite other users into the conversation without asking other participants for an approval.

## Can I leave a conversation?
Yes, you can leave an ongoing conversation at any time. Once you left the conversation, you will not receive any messages sent into the conversation by other users.

## Can I rejoin a conversation I had left?
Yes. To rejoin a conversation, you will need to be invited by one of the active participants. However, if you leave a conversation that had only 1 other participant, the conversation will be permanently closed.

## Can I remove someone from a conversation?
No, once joined, a person cannot be removed from a conversation unless they leave voluntarily.

## Can I delete or edit a message after sending it?
You can edit a message within 5 minutes of sending it. After that period, you cannot modify it. However, you can send an expiring message that will be automatically deleted after the time period you select and none of the conversation participants will be able to see or retrieve it.

## What are expiring messages and how do they work?
An expiring message will be automatically deleted from the conversation after the time period selected and its contents will be completely gone from our servers within 24 hours.
