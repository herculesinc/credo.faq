# Reputation and Feedback

## What is the Credo Score and how is it calculated?
Your Credo Score is an indicator of your credibility. It is measured on the scale of 0 to 360 and consists of following three components:

* Identity component measures how much confidence we have in knowing that you are who you say you are. It consists of credibility of your Verifications and your Credo Profile strength. For example, even though you do not have to fill out all of the profile fields, the more complete your profile, the stronger it is. Also, your profile strength increases significantly if your name and/or other profile fields match your social media profiles.
* Endorsements component depends on the number and reputation of people who are willing to vouch for you - i.e., people in your Circle of Trust. Generally speaking, the more people you have in your Circle of Trust and the better their reputation, the higher the bump in your Credo Score. However, once you reach about a dozen of people in your Circle of Trust, any further increase in the number of people will not have a significant effect on your Credo Score.
* Feedback component has the greatest impact on your Credo score and consists of ratings and reviews you receive from other users. The more consistent and positive ratings you receive, the higher your Credo Score will be and vice-versa.

Even though Identity and Endorsements components do not affect your Credo Score as strongly as the Feedback, they are important components overall. This means that having credible verifications, strong profile and reliable people in your Circle of Trust will help improve your Credo Score.

## What is Provisional Reputation?
When you first join Credo, your Reputation level is set to "Provisional". This simply means that you are a new user, and you haven't yet had the chance to build your [Credo Score](#what-is-the-credo-score-and-how-is-it-calculated). Provisional Reputation is available for two weeks to give you the time to add verifications, fill out your profile information and add people to your Circle of Trust. After the two-week period, your Reputation Level will reflect your actual Credo Score.

## What is Feedback?
Feedback consists of Ratings and Reviews. A rating can be one of the following values:

* Positive - you had a positive experience dealing with a person, and you would recommend them to others
* Negative - you had a negative experience dealing with a person, others should be careful when dealing with them
* Terrible - you had major problems dealing with a person, 

A Review is a description of your interaction with someone in addition to a rating. For example, "I rented a room from Alison. She was very friendly. Everything was as described." This provides a little more information to others when they are considering whether a certain user can be trusted.

## For whom can I provide feedback and when?
You can rate Credo users if you are friends with them on Facebook at any time. As for the rest of the users, you can rate them only after you have a transaction or some interaction with them on Credo. The more you interact with a certain user, the higher the impact your rating will have on their Credo Score.

Reviews are only available after having a transaction or significant amount of interaction with a user unless that person is in your Circle of Trust. As for people in your Circle of Trust, you can review them at any time.

## How can I view reviews written about other people?
To view someone's reviews, you must ask them to share their reviews with you. You can do that after you've exchanged a few messages via Credo Messenger. If the other person agrees to share their reviews with you, you'll see a randomly selected sample of their reviews, and you'll have a 7-day window to read through them. Currently, the sample size is 5 reviews, but in the future, we'll make it customizable.

## Can I change my review or rating after submitting it?
For the people in your Circle of Trust, you can change ratings and reviews you wrote at any time. With regards to the rest of the users, you can change ratings and reviews you wrote within 21 days of your last interaction with them.

## Can I change or delete reviews written about me by other users?
No, you cannot change or delete reviews written by other users.

## What should I do if I see or receive an inappropriate review?
Please flag that review as inappropriate or contact us at [support@credo360.com](mailto:support@credo360.com) to report it.

## What if someone writes a negative review about me or gives me a low rating?
[Credo Score](#what-is-the-credo-score-and-how-is-it-calculated) is calculated to take into account the majority and consistency of your ratings. Thus, if you mostly have good ratings, then one or very few negative ratings will not bring down your Credo Score significantly. Similarly, if you mostly have good reviews and a good Credo Score, other users will probably not rely on that one negative review when determining your credibility.
