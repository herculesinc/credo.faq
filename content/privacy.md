# Privacy

## Can I control what people see on my profile?
You can set each of the profile elements to be Private, meaning visible only to your Circle of Trust, or Public, meaning visible to everyone. However, your first name, location country and [Credo Score](reputation-and-feedback#what-is-the-credo-score-and-how-is-it-calculated) are always public and anyone can see them.

To people outside of your [Circle of Trust](contacts#what-is-a-circle-of-trust), "Private" profile elements will be displayed as follows:

* last name will show as an initial
* profile picture will be blurred
* birthday will not be shown
* location city will not be shown
* gender will not be shown

Verifications you add to your account are shown on your profile page as described [here](#how-will-other-people-see-my-verifications).

## How will other people see my verifications?
Your verifications are only used to verify your account and are never shared with anyone. Other users will only be able to see the method of verification you provided with the minimal information that will help them determine whether your account can be trusted. Publicly visible info for each verification is described below:

* If you have a verified Facebook account, your Credo profile will display the number of your Facebook friends and the date when you last synced your Facebook account with Credo.
* If you have a verified LinkedIn account, your Credo profile will display the number of your LinkedIn connections and the date when you last synced your LinkedIn account with Credo.
* If you have a verified Twitter account, your Credo profile will display the number of your Twitter followers and the date when you last synced Twitter account with Credo.
* If you have a verified Reddit account, your Credo profile will display how long you have been a Reddit user and the date when you last synced your Reddit account with Credo.
* If you have a verified email address, you can choose to either completely hide your email or to display the first and the last two letters of the username along with the email provider (Yahoo, Gmail, etc.) e.g. ixxxya@gmail.com.
* If you have a verified phone number, you can choose to display only the country code or a combination of country code, area code, and the last 2 digits of your phone number, e.g. 1.123.xxx.xx34.

## Who can see reviews written for me?
People in your [Circle of Trust](contacts#what-is-a-circle-of-trust) can see your reviews as well as users who wrote reviews for you will see what they had written. Nobody else can see your reviews. However, if you want to show your reviews to someone, you can.

## Who can see reviews I wrote for others?
Once you write a review, it's up to the person, for whom you wrote it, to determine who will be able to see the review. However, they will not be able to display your Credo ID or your full name with the review (only your first name and last initial will be visible).
