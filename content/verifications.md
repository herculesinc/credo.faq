# Verifications

## What is account verification?
Account verifications help us ensure that Credo users are real people and they are who they say they are. We offer multiple [verification methods](#what-account-verifications-do-you-support), such as using your social profiles or government-issued ID. However, for login purposes, we require at least Facebook, LinkedIn, phone number or email verification.

Not all verifications are the same. For example, verifying your account with an established Facebook profile will improve your [Credo Score](reputation-and-feedback#what-is-the-credo-score-and-how-is-it-calculated) much more than verifying it with your email. However, the most reliable verification method is [Identity Verification](#what-is-identity-verification). All in all, the more verifications you attach to your account, the higher your Credo Score will be.

## What account verifications do you support?
Currently, we support the following verification methods: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, [Identity Verification](#what-is-identity-verification), bank account (currently available only in the U.S.), Coinbase, mobile phone, and email. However, we are working hard and planning to add more verification methods later in 2018. Such verifications might include Google+, physical address, and Credit Report.

## What is Identity Verification?
Identity Verification is a reliable way to ensure that users create real accounts. We'll ask you to provide some basic information about yourself, including a form of identification (e.g. your SSN). Then we'll match this info against publicly available data sources to make sure that everything checks out. We'll also ask you a few simple questions to which you alone should know the answers. The whole process will take no more than a couple of minutes, and by the end of it your account will gain a lot of credibility.

Currently, Identity Verification is only available in the U.S. In rare cases, when there isn't enough public data, we will not be able to verify your identity using this method. However, we are working on adding other forms of Identity Verification to make it available to everyone.

## When I connect Facebook or LinkedIn to my account, does anything from Credo appear on these sites?
No, we will never post anything to your Facebook or LinkedIn profiles. We access your Facebook and/or LinkedIn profiles only to verify that data in your Social Media profiles matches with your Credo profile.

## Can I remove verifications from my Credo account?
You can add and remove account verifications at any time. However, there are two important things to keep in mind. Firstly, removing verifications is very likely to decrease credibility of your account and will reduce your [Credo Score](reputation-and-feedback#what-is-the-credo-score-and-how-is-it-calculated). Secondly, you should keep at least one active verification connected to your account. Otherwise, you will not be able to log in.

Please note that verifications you remove will be encrypted and stored in the system in order to prevent creation of multiple accounts with the same verifications.

## Can I open two different accounts using the same verification?
No, you cannot. For example, you cannot have two different accounts connected to the same mobile phone number. For some verifications (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn), even if you delete them from one account, you will not be able to open a different account using them.

## Can I merge accounts open through different verification methods?
Not yet, but this functionality is coming soon.
