# Credo Wallet

## What is Credo Wallet?
Credo Wallet allows you to make and accept payments for goods and services right here on Credo. It works very similarly to how PayPal or Venmo work: you can hold a balance on Credo, make instant payments from this balance to other user, and easily move money between your wallet and a U.S. bank or credit union account.

## Who can use Credo Wallet?
Currently, Credo Wallet is available only in the U.S. for users who are 18 or older. To use Credo Wallet, you don't need to have a U.S. bank account. However, to move money in and out of your wallet, you will need to connect it to a U.S. bank or credit union account.

## How can I enable Credo Wallet?
To enable Credo Wallet for your account, we'll need to make sure you are a real person. We will ask you to provide basic identify info, including last four digits of your Social Security number. We never store your SSN (or its last 4 digits) in our system - it is discarded right after we verify your identity. For more information, refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.credo360.com/legal#privacy).

## How do I link a bank account to my Credo Wallet?
There are two ways: instant account verification and micro-deposits.

With instant account verification, we'll be able to verify your account, well, instantly. To do this, we'll ask you to provide your bank username and password. Once the bank confirms that your username and password are correct, you're good to go. We never store your bank login info in our system - it is discarded right after we verify your account. For more information, refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.credo360.com/legal#privacy).

With micro-deposits, you'll need to provide your bank's routing number and your account number. Then, we'll make two small deposits into your account. Once the deposits arrive (may take up to 3 - 4 business days), you'll need to log back in to Credo to verify the deposited amounts.
